# Research Scope & Multi-Chain Context

## Purpose of This Document

This repository contains verifier implementations for multiple blockchain execution environments (Solana, Stellar, Mantra/CosmWasm). This document clarifies the **research scope** and explains why multiple chains exist in a single repository.

---

## Multi-Chain Implementations: Why?

The presence of multiple chain implementations serves **research purposes only**:

1. **Cross-VM Feasibility Study**: Demonstrates that Groth16 proofs generated by SP1 can be verified across different execution environments (EVM, WASM, SVM)

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Allows comparison of:
   - Gas costs across chains
   - Verification performance
   - Developer experience
   - Cryptographic library support

3. **Technical Validation**: Proves the concept is not chain-specific and could theoretically work on multiple platforms

## What This Does NOT Mean

### ❌ NOT a Universal Protocol

This is **not** a production-ready multi-chain protocol. Each verifier implementation is:
- A research prototype
- Not audited
- Not optimized
- Not production-tested

### ❌ NOT All In-Scope for Grants

Any grant application using this repository is scoped to **ONE specific chain**. Other implementations are:
- Background research
- Technical validation
- Not part of grant deliverables

### ❌ NOT Production Deployments

None of these verifiers are deployed to mainnet. They are:
- Testnet experiments only
- Subject to breaking changes
- Not supported for production use

## Chain-Specific Status

### Solana (Anchor)

**Status**: Research prototype  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate SVM compatibility  
**Limitations**:
- Not optimized for Solana's compute unit model
- No integration with Solana's account model
- No SPL token integration
- Gas costs not benchmarked at scale

**If Grant-Funded**: Would require complete rewrite for production

### Stellar (Soroban)

**Status**: Research prototype  
**Purpose**: Explore Protocol 25 BN254 pairing support  
**Limitations**:
- Minimal testing on Stellar testnet
- No integration with Stellar's asset model
- No consideration of Stellar's fee structure
- Protocol 25 features not fully utilized

**If Grant-Funded**: Would require significant optimization and testing

### Mantra (CosmWasm)

**Status**: Research prototype  
**Purpose**: Validate WASM-based verification  
**Limitations**:
- Generic CosmWasm, not Mantra-specific
- No integration with Mantra's RWA features
- No consideration of Mantra's governance model
- Not tested on Mantra testnet

**If Grant-Funded**: Would require Mantra-specific customization

## Grant Application Guidance

### If Applying for a Solana Grant

**In-Scope**:
- Solana verifier optimization
- Anchor program production hardening
- Solana-specific use case (e.g., SPL token compliance)

**Out-of-Scope**:
- Stellar and Mantra implementations (remain as research artifacts)
- Cross-chain features
- Universal protocol claims

### If Applying for a Stellar Grant

**In-Scope**:
- Stellar verifier optimization
- Protocol 25 BN254 integration
- Stellar-specific use case (e.g., asset compliance)

**Out-of-Scope**:
- Solana and Mantra implementations (remain as research artifacts)
- Cross-chain features
- Universal protocol claims

### If Applying for a Mantra Grant

**In-Scope**:
- Mantra verifier optimization
- CosmWasm production hardening
- Mantra RWA-specific use case

**Out-of-Scope**:
- Solana and Stellar implementations (remain as research artifacts)
- Cross-chain features
- Universal protocol claims

---

## Why Keep All Implementations in One Repo?

**Research Efficiency**:
- Shared core logic (SP1 adapter, guest program)
- Easier comparison of different approaches
- Single codebase for technical validation

**Transparency**:
- Shows full scope of research exploration
- Demonstrates technical breadth
- Allows reviewers to see all work

**Future Flexibility**:
- If one chain proves viable, others can be archived
- If research pivots, code is available
- Comparative data is preserved

---

## Honest Assessment

### What Works

- SP1 proof generation and Groth16 wrapping
- Basic on-chain verification on all three chains
- Cross-VM technical feasibility demonstrated

### What Doesn't Work (Yet)

- Production-grade gas optimization
- Chain-specific feature integration
- Economic viability at scale
- Security hardening
- Real-world use case validation

---

## Recommended Grant Approach

1. **Choose ONE chain** as primary focus
2. **Define ONE specific use case** (e.g., payroll compliance, asset verification)
3. **Archive or clearly label** other chain implementations as "research only"
4. **Set realistic milestones** based on chosen chain
5. **Be explicit** about what's in-scope vs. out-of-scope

---

## Conclusion

This repository represents **exploratory research** into ZK compliance proofs across multiple execution environments. It is **not** a universal protocol, production system, or multi-chain product.

Any grant application should focus on **one chain, one use case, realistic scope**.
